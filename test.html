                Hi, I'm Abby Crockett, a senior CS with Cybersecurity major at Oklahoma Christian University. 
                What I love most about computer science is the constant opportunity to learn and be 
                creative. Itâ€™s fascinating to experience how things work, 
                especially when discovering how programming evolved from Assembly language into 
                languages like C++.

                Hi, I'm Ian White, a senior CS with Gaming and Animation major at Oklahoma Christian University. 
                I've always been interested in the rules and mechanics of video games as I grew up. This turned 
                into a fascination with coding as I made my way through high school and eventually to my major
                at OC. I enjoy developing games, mechanics, and rulesets and coding them into reality.

                Hi, I'm Chandler Hurt, <br> 
                a senior CS with Gaming & Animation major at Oklahoma Christian University. I've been working with computers for 
                pretty much my whole life and it's been great being able to push my knowledge further. I love working 
                with computers every day and getting to make games is wonderful!

                Hi, I'm Samantha Wiggs,  
                a senior CS major at Oklahoma Christian University. With a father in computer science, I grew up with many of different 
                principles being taught to me. It was an easy transition to get into programming and computer science. I have grown to love CS 
                and am excited to spend my career in the tech field.
