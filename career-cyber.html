        Cybersecurity might be for you if you like learning
        how things work and how to either hack or defend systems.
        Roles focused on offensive security typically fall under red teams, 
        while defensive roles are part of blue teams.
        The SANS Institute outlined a few different possible career
        paths. <br>

        <br> 1. Digital Forensics Analyst <br>
        This role is best suited for those who like searching for evidence. <br>

        - “Forensics is about diving deep into any system and device 
        and locating the problem so as to develop a solution.” - Patricia M <br>

        <br> 2. Pen tester <br>
        This role is perfect for those who like enjoy uncovering vulnerabilities
         and thinking outside the box.

        <br>
        “It is not only about using existing tools and methods, 
        you must be creative and understand the logic of the application 
        and make guesses about the infrastructure.” - Dan-Mihai Negrea <br>

        <br> 3. Intrusion Detection / SOC Analyst <br>
        This role is ideal for those who enjoy the thought of monitoring and 
        protecting systems, so that vulnerabilities can be detected quickly. <br>

        “The intrusion analyst is the guard at the gate and can get great 
        job satisfaction from detecting and stopping network intrusions.” - Chuck Ballard <br>

        <br> If any of these roles sound interesting to you, you can start learning right away.
         In college, you might work with tools like Wireshark and virtual machines running Kali Linux.
         Competitions like the National Cyber League and interactive lessons on TryHackMe.com
          are great ways to build your skills.
