    <p class="description">
        Many people rely on computer scientists everyday,
        without giving it much thought until something doesn't work. 
        From playing games on your phone to building
        the databases for hospitals, computer science is a career 
        path that will always have jobs.
        <br><br>

        Computer science has many different types of lucrative jobs.
        In learning how to solve complex problems it can help you
        in your everyday life. The job will never grow stale, there
        will always be new things to explore. This can be seen with
        how quickly computers have gone from the size of entire buildings
        to far more sophiscated computers fitting in our pockets.
        If you decide you don't like one particular ascept of
        computer science you can choose a different area to work in.
        For me, I took gaming and animation classes in high school. I found
        out that it wasn't what I was wanting to do. Still, I am glad
        I took those classes because it helped me get better at 
        learning new things.
