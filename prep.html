    <p class="description">
        One of the best ways to start preparing is by learning how to code. 
        Instead of just watching YouTube videos about programming, 
        working on JavaScript projects is a great way to retain knowledge. 
        A simple first project could be building a calculator.

        If you already know what topic you are interested in, this

        has plenty of free online courses to explore. <br> <br>

        One big part of computer science is learning how to learn.
        In one of my first programming classes we wrote code on paper.
        I think it is good to memorize common algorithms and be 
        able to write them in psuedo code. Psuedo code for making a 
        pizza might include: 
        <br><br> Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. <br>
        Place the pizza crust on a baking sheet. <br>
        Spread tomato sauce on the crust. <br>
        Sprinkle cheese on the crust. <br>
        Bake the pizza in the oven for 20 minutes. <br>
